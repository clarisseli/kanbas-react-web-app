# Kambaz

Kambaz is a rudimentary version of the widely acclaimed Learning Management System (LMS), Canvas. 
This full-stack application provides an educational platform with features including interactive quizzes, course management, and assignments. The system supports multiple user roles - students, faculty, and administrators - each with tailored features and permissions. This repository contains the frontend client application and requires the backend server to be running for full functionality. Here's the [link](https://github.com/clarisseli/kambaz-node-server-app) to the backend repository.
